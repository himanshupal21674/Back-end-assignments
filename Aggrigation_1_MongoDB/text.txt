Note:-
"Each query uses the $match stage for filtering documents based on certain criteria.
The $project stage is used to specify which fields to include or exclude in the output.
For questions involving retrieval of specific fields without _id, _id: 0 is used in $project to exclude the _id field.
Some questions are duplicated or very similar; I've combined answers where appropriate."
